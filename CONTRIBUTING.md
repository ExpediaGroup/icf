### Bugs
We use Github Issues for our bug reporting. If you find a bug in one of the templates or tools, please make sure the bug isn't already listed before opening a new issue.

### Feedback & Enhancement Requests
If you have feedback, questions, or enhancement requests for the Core API or any Capability API please use the appropriate Slack channel at https://theicf.slack.com.

### Peer Review & Acceptance Process
If you would like to propose a change or addition, please fork the repository and then open a Pull Request. This will provide a place for comments and feedback to be given. The initial peer review process will allow 2 weeks for feedback. If any substantial changes are required before acceptance the peer review process may take longer. Once feedback has been received and addressed, the working group will vote to adopt the changes into the official API, the changes will be merged, CHANGELOG.md updated, and minimum supported version will be assigned to the updated API changes.

### Contributing to Documentation
To contribute to documentation, you can directly modify the corresponding .md files in the docs directory. Please submit a pull request. Once your PR is merged, the documentation is automatically built and made publicly available.
